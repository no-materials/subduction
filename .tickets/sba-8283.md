# Wire actual-present feedback into Apple backend scheduling loop

Add Apple backend helper API that constructs PresentFeedback from submission observations and PresentHints, including deterministic missed-deadline heuristic when actual present timestamps are unavailable.

## Acceptance Criteria

Public helper API exists in subduction-backend-apple; unit tests cover expected/actual and commit-deadline paths; scheduler.observe integration test demonstrates depth adaptation when misses are reported.


## Notes

**2026-02-14T15:39:36Z**

Implemented make_present_feedback(hints, build_start, submitted_at, actual_present) in subduction-backend-apple/src/lib.rs. Heuristic: prefer actual>expected when both known; fallback to submitted_at>latest_commit. Added tests including scheduler.observe integration path.
