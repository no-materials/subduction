//! Capability-graded timing model.
//!
//! This module defines the types that flow between backends and the scheduler:
//!
//! - [`TimingConfidence`] — how much the platform can tell us about presentation
//! - [`FrameTick`] — a frame opportunity delivered by the backend
//! - [`FramePlan`] — what the engine uses to evaluate the scene for a frame
//! - [`PresentHints`] — submission constraints from the backend
//! - [`PresentFeedback`] — post-submit observations fed back to the scheduler
//!
//! # Data flow
//!
//! Each frame follows a pipeline through these types:
//!
//! 1. The backend produces a [`FrameTick`] from a platform callback (e.g.
//!    `CADisplayLink`, `requestAnimationFrame`).
//! 2. The backend computes [`PresentHints`] from the tick and platform
//!    knowledge (deadlines, desired present time).
//! 3. [`Scheduler::plan()`](crate::scheduler::Scheduler::plan) consumes the
//!    tick and hints to produce a [`FramePlan`] with a sampling time, target
//!    presentation time, and commit deadline.
//! 4. The application uses the plan's [`sample_time`](FramePlan::sample_time)
//!    to evaluate animation/simulation state and build/submit the frame.
//! 5. After submission, the backend constructs [`PresentFeedback`] from
//!    timing observations and feeds it back to
//!    [`Scheduler::observe()`](crate::scheduler::Scheduler::observe) to
//!    adapt pipeline depth and safety margins.
