//! Dirty-tracking channel constants.
//!
//! Subduction uses multi-channel dirty tracking (via [`understory_dirty`]) to
//! efficiently propagate invalidation through the layer tree. Each channel
//! represents an independent category of change.
//!
//! # Propagation semantics
//!
//! Channels differ in whether dirtiness propagates to descendants:
//!
//! - **Propagating** — [`TRANSFORM`] and [`OPACITY`] use
//!   [`EagerPolicy`](understory_dirty::EagerPolicy) and have dependency
//!   edges from child to parent. Marking a parent dirty automatically marks
//!   all descendants, because world transforms, effective opacities, and
//!   effective hidden state are inherited properties. (Hidden-flag changes
//!   are routed through [`TRANSFORM`] so that the same drain pass
//!   recomputes both world transforms and `effective_hidden`.)
//!
//! - **Local-only** — [`CLIP`] and [`CONTENT`] are marked with the default
//!   policy. Only the explicitly marked layer appears in the drain output,
//!   since clip shapes and surface content are per-layer properties.
//!
//! - **Structural** — [`TOPOLOGY`] is marked on topology mutations
//!   (add/remove child, create/destroy layer). It triggers a traversal-order
//!   rebuild during evaluation but does not propagate to descendants.
//!
//! # Consumption
//!
//! Callers never need to query dirty state directly. Each
//! [`LayerStore::evaluate`](crate::layer::LayerStore::evaluate) call drains
//! all channels and surfaces the results as
//! [`FrameChanges`](crate::layer::FrameChanges), which backends
//! [consume](crate::backend::Presenter::apply) to apply incremental updates.
